##### Question

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:

Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,

return [0, 1].

##### Code

It's easy to finish, so just read the [code](../twosum.h), and I wrote some comments in there.
We'll try a better way when we finish the hash map.
