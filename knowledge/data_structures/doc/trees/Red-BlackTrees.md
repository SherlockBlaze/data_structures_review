### What's it for?

We got a binary search tree, and we know that a binary search tree of height ***h*** can support any of the basic dynamic-set operations - such as **Search**, **Predecessor** -- in ***O(h)*** time. ***The set operations are fast if the height of the search tree is small.*** So! **If its height is large, the set operations may run no faster than a linked list.**
