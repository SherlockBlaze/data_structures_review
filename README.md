# All My Knowledge Review

***WARNING: My English is REALLY POOR!!***

> Not only about the computer science review I go before and not get yet, but also about math, english, physics and so on, everything I got before and not get yet, I'll review here. And it's a long-term battle, the content will be updated everyday. 
+ **We review theoretical knowledge from Monday to Firday, and we will do do some exercises or write code on weekends. If it is a basic subject, we will find some classic and difficult exercises to complete.**
+ **We will also discuss some classic or excellent projects, such as an operating system, network protocols, Redis, Nginx and so on.**
+ **We will certainly do our own actual combat projects, all here, from the beginningã€‚**

**Let's GO!!!!**
