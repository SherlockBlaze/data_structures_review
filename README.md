# Data Structures & Algorithms Review

***WARNING: My English is REALLY POOR!!***

> We'll review the data structure and classic algorithms of the planning system. Includes machine learning and deep learning maybe more. This is a long-term battle, the content will be updated every day, keep up. We start with basic data structures and advanced data structures. Since our code will be mainly implemented in C/C++ and Python languages, in order to facilitate your learning, I will also summarize some of the programming language used,including and not limited to the knowledge used. Finally, we will try to use the knowledge we have learned to achieve some classic functions. For example, an operating system, or some network protocol implementation. Finally, we will talk about machine learning and deep learning related content, from the current basic relevant knowledge.And the reading of the paper and the implementation of related content. At the same time, we will summarize relevant mathematics knowledge to help you understand and learn, and still include and not limited to the knowledge used.
